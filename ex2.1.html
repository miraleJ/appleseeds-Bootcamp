        <strong> A tree </strong> typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. <br>
        This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, <br>
        and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. <br>
        <em> For most trees </em> it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. <br>
        Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; <br>
        they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. <br>
        Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. <br>
        The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, <br>
        providing the <q> food</q> for the tree's growth and development.
